## How I work

- I like understanding systems end-to-end, from field conditions to final deliverables  
- I focus on data quality, clarity, and defensibility  
- I enjoy turning messy information into usable workflows  
- I tend to learn by doing and iterating rather than over-planning

## Other things I work on

Outside of my core engineering role, I also spend time on:
- visual art and mixed-media work  
- drone photography and site documentation  
- small side projects exploring technology, design, and systems  

These live elsewhere on the site.
