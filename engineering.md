## Engineering

I work in environmental engineering with a focus on **data integrity, field-to-report workflows, and regulatory clarity**.  
Most of my work lives in the space between raw data and decision-making.

---

## Current role

### Environmental Data Management Specialist  
**Tighe & Bond**

I support multi-year environmental investigation, remediation, and compliance projects by managing and interpreting environmental data across laboratory, field, and regulatory contexts.

Core responsibilities include:
- QA/QC of environmental datasets (soil, groundwater, stormwater, wastewater)
- Integration of laboratory results with field sampling data
- Application of state and federal regulatory criteria (CT DEEP, EPA)
- Preparation of clear, defensible data summaries for project teams and clients

---

## Technical focus areas

### Environmental data & QA/QC
- Laboratory data validation and review
- Analytical method consistency checks
- Identification of data gaps, anomalies, and reporting issues
- Standardization of datasets across projects and programs

### Field & site work
- Groundwater, stormwater, and wastewater sampling
- Site investigations and compliance monitoring
- Emergency response documentation (e.g. transformer oil and dielectric fluid releases)
- Coordination between field observations and analytical results

### Technical deliverables
- AutoCAD / Civil 3D figures for:
  - SWPPP and SPCC plans
  - site/civil/HBMA drawing/proposal sets
  - regulatory submissions
- Clear data tables and summaries that support permitting and compliance decisions

---

## Tools & workflows

I work regularly with:
- AutoCAD / Civil 3D  
- ArcGIS / Surfer / Strater 
- Environmental databases (e.g. EnviroData)  
- Excel-based data workflows and QA tools  

I’m particularly interested in improving how data moves from:
**field → lab → database → report**  
without losing context or quality.

## Prior experience

### Environmental Compliance Engineer  
**Fuss & O’Neill**
- Inspected industrial and municipal facilities
- Evaluated regulatory compliance and operational effectiveness
- Developed site plans and technical documentation

### Laboratory Technician  
**Henkel**
- Conducted chemistry testing and data reporting
- Maintained laboratory safety and QA protocols

---

## Professional interests

I’m especially interested in:
- improving environmental data workflows
- bridging technical work and clear communication
- projects where engineering decisions are informed by both field conditions and data quality

More detailed case studies and examples will live here over time.
