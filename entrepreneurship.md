## Entrepreneurship

I’ve spent the last few years building and testing small, real businesses alongside my engineering career.  
Not pitch decks — actual operations, clients, revenue, and exits.

These experiences shape how I approach engineering work: ownership, communication, and an understanding of how technical decisions connect to real-world outcomes.

## VendX LLC  
**Co-Founder | 2023 – 2025**

VendX was an early-stage vending and services business focused on unconventional site placements and operational efficiency.

**What I did:**
- Built the company from concept to revenue-generating operation
- Secured the first clients through direct outreach and needs assessment
- Acted as the primary point of contact for customers, vendors, and partners
- Coordinated operations, logistics, and ongoing client relationships
- Worked directly with Connecticut state regulators to define and approve a compliant operating framework

**Outcome:**
- Achieved early traction and operational stability
- Successfully exited the business in 2025, transitioning operations to new leadership

This experience taught me how to:
- Navigate ambiguity and incomplete information
- Communicate clearly with non-technical stakeholders
- Make decisions under constraint and accountability

## LPR Systems (In Progress)  
**Founder | Drone & Media Services**

LPR Systems is a developing drone and media project focused on environmental documentation, construction progress, and site visualization.

Current focus areas:
- Aerial documentation for environmental and construction projects
- Visual storytelling for site conditions, constraints, and change over time
- Integrating field data, imagery, and narrative into clear deliverables

This project is intentionally lightweight and experimental — designed to explore how visual tools can support better technical communication.

## ZSC LLC  
**Co-Founder | 2019 – 2021**

ZSC LLC was an early-stage venture focused on the planning, design, and permitting of a regulated Cannabis cultivation facility in Massachusetts.

The work emphasized applying engineering and regulatory principles within a highly constrained compliance environment.

**Key contributions included:**
- Applied engineering fundamentals to design a ~5,000 square foot indoor cultivation facility using AutoCAD
- Developed a comprehensive business plan integrating operational, regulatory, and spatial constraints
- Optimized facility layout and design parameters to align with environmental, safety, and commission requirements
- Prepared technical and strategic presentations for review by external stakeholders
- Successfully obtained local permission to pursue development of the proposed facility
- Navigated conflicts between environmental regulations, commission guidelines, and municipal procedures

Although the project did not advance to full commercial buildout, it provided early, hands-on experience with:
- permitting workflows
- regulatory interpretation
- compliance-driven design
- translating technical plans into defensible, review-ready documentation

This project directly informed my interest in regulated systems and continues to shape how I approach environmental and compliance-focused engineering work.

## How This Informs My Engineering Work

Entrepreneurial work has made me a better engineer by reinforcing:

- Ownership over outcomes, not just tasks
- Clear communication across technical and non-technical audiences
- Comfort operating without rigid instructions
- Respect for timelines, budgets, and stakeholder priorities

I bring this mindset back into traditional engineering environments — especially where data, documentation, and decision-making intersect.
